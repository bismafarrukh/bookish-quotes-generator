# bookish-quotes-generator
As a book reader, it was always hard for me to have a single place for all my beloved quotes. This simple quote generator generates quotes randomly from my favouite books. The idea was to create a simple site where I can have my favourite quotes and where I can go back again and again for rereading my favourite lines.
